# Readsy
Application for fostering reading in Immaculata Middle School classes.

## What it does
Readsy is a platform that enables the sharing and discovery of new books between IMS students. The benefit of Readsy is that all submissions are reviewed by IMS teachers before being made available to the students, enabling young students to connect with each other without threat of mal-intentioned third parties. Students are able review and rate books, as well as save them to their personal library, creating a personalized experience for each user. 
## How its built
The web application is built with an AngularJS frontend and Node.js for backend functionality, and a MongoDB database. Information about student uploaded books is corraborated by the Google Books API, and confirmed by a live administrator. Information about the books is also gathered by leveraging the Google Books API, this includes a short description and an image of the cover.
